Inspired by physicist Richard Feynman famous saying 
> "If you want to master something, teach it. The more you teach, the more you understand it. In order to understand something, you must understand the broader context of related concepts."

By mastering database optimization techniques, engineers can gain a deeper understanding of internal database operations, enhancing their insight into system design principles that are widely applicable across various domains. 

For instance, 

1. Knowledge of data structures such as B-Trees, commonly used for indexing 
2. Understanding read-write strategies in relational database management systems (RDBMS) provide valuable case studies that can inform the design of efficient, scalable systems
3. Examining execution plan enhance understanding of system design
