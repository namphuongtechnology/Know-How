This repository will document and present my know-how study plan to become a Senior Full Stack Engineer. The result of the study is stored as a series of files in this repository. The files are created using [XMind](https://xmind.app/), in order to examine all details without any compression, contact the author to obtain the original resources.

# Database
By mastering database optimization techniques, engineers can gain a deeper understanding of internal database operations, enhancing their insight into system design principles that are widely applicable across various domains. 

For instance, 

1. Knowledge of as B-Trees, commonly used for indexing, enhances understanding of data structures  
2. Understanding read-write strategies in relational database management systems (RDBMS) provide valuable case studies that can inform the design of efficient, scalable systems
3. Examining execution plan enhances understanding of overall system design principles
